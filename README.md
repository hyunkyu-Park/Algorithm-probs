The algorithm files here are solutions to problems from the Samsung's special lectures on algorithm this summer from July 17th to August 25th
I worked on these files for approximately 6 weeks, challenging myself every day for 8 hours, 7 days a week.

Reason for Studying Algorithms and Data Structures:  
I decided to study algorithms and data structures because I believe that building a strong foundation in these areas will greatly contribute to my future development skills.   
Also, I believe that working for a company could lead me to writing code in limited resources or situations due to many reasons such as legacy codes or infrastructure problems. Therefore, I am preparing in advance for situations like this, practicing code optimization and preparing to increase the efficiency of time and memory.

Topics Covered in Samsung's Lectures and Notes:   
STL, Bit Manipulation, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Heaps,
Greedy Algorithms, Hashing, Divide and Conquer, Binary Search, Trie, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Segment Trees.
