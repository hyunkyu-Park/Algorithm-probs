The algorithm files here are solutions to problems from the Samsung's special lectures on algorithm this summer from July 17th to August 25th
I worked on these files for approximately 6 weeks, challenging myself every day for 8 hours, 7 days a week.

Reason for Studying Algorithms and Data Structures:
I decided to study algorithms and data structures because I believe that building a strong foundation in these areas
will greatly contribute to my future development skills, based on my experience with related courses from the previous semester.

Topics Covered in Samsung's Lectures and Notes:
STL, Bit Manipulation, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Heaps,
Greedy Algorithms, Hashing, Divide and Conquer, Binary Search, Trie, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Segment Trees.
